## Introduction

Test reference to @tbl-irismeans

Test reference to @fig-basehist.

Test reference to @sec-figures.

To create a reference-able code block, add a #lst- identifier along with a lst-cap attribute. For example: test reference to code chunk @lst-codeblock

``` {#lst-codeblock .r lst-cap="Example for a referencable code block"}
4+4
```

## Callout blocks

::: callout-note
Note that there are five types of callouts, including: `note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

::: callout-tip
## Tip With Caption

This is an example of a callout with a caption.
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Expand To Learn About Collapse

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.

### Mathjax

A little math formula :

$$x = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{\frac{y}{i}} $$

Here is a more complex example where the equation is embedded in a LaTeX equation environment including numbering and crossreferencing:

If the random variable $Y$ follows a standard normal distribution, i.e. $Y \sim N(0,1)$, it's density function can be described with

$$
f_{Y}(y)=\varphi(y) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp \left\{ -\frac{y^2}{2} \right\}, \quad y \in \mathbb{R}.
$$ {#eq-density-norm}

$\pi$ represents the circle number or Ludolph's number. The function

$$
  F_{Y}(y)=\Phi(y) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \int_{-\infty}^y \varphi(x) \,\mathrm{d}x, \quad y \in \mathbb{R}
$$ {#eq-dist-func}

represents then the distribution function of @eq-density-norm.

## Analysis

### Tables

Here is a simple table based on Markdown Syntax:

| Col1 | Col2 | Col3 |
|------|------|------|
| A    | B    | C    |
| E    | F    | G    |
| A    | G    | G    |

: My Caption {#tbl-letters}

See @tbl-letters.

Here is a sample table output using the `knitr::kable()` function.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-irismeans
#| tbl-cap: "Species-specific mean lengths and widths."
tab <- aggregate(. ~ Species, data = iris, mean)
kable(tab)
```

### Figures {#sec-figures}

A base graphics histogram (click on the figure to enlarge it):

```{r basehist}
#| fig-cap: "A Histogram made with the basic graphics package"
#| label: fig-basehist
#| 
hist(rnorm(100))
```

## Diagrams

### Mermaid

Mermaid is a Javascript based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams.

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Hard edge] --> B(Round edge)
  B --> C{Decision}
  C --> D[Result one]
  C --> E[Result two]
```

```{mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
  participant Alice
  participant Bob
  Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
  loop Healthcheck
    John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
  end
  Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail!
  John-->>Alice: Great!
  John->>Bob: How about you?
  Bob-->>John: Jolly good!
```

### Graphviz

The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats. Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.

```{dot}
graph G {
  layout=neato
  run -- intr;
  intr -- runbl;
  runbl -- run;
  run -- kernel;
  kernel -- zombie;
  kernel -- sleep;
  kernel -- runmem;
  sleep -- swap;
  swap -- runswap;
  runswap -- new;
  runswap -- runmem;
  new -- runmem;
  sleep -- runmem;
}
```

## Conclusions

Here is a footnote reference[^1], and another[^2].

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^2]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first line. In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like multi-paragraph list items.

## Adding citations and bibliography

Link a `.bib` document via the YAML header, and the bibliography will be printed at the very end (as usual). The default bibliography style is provided in the `bib.bst` file (do not delete), which adopts the [SAGE Harvard](https://uk.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/sage_harvard_reference_style_0.pdf) reference style.

References can be cited directly within the document using the R Markdown equivalent of the \LaTeX citation system `[@key]`, where key is the citation key in the first line of the entry in the .bib file. Example: [@Taylor1937]. To cite multiple entries, separate the keys by semicolons (e.g., [@Knupp1999; @Kamm2000]. You can also write in-text citations, as follows: @Taylor1937 say this and that.

There is also the package [citr](https://github.com/crsh/citr) which I highly recommend: *citr* provides functions and an RStudio add-in to search a BibTeX-file to create and insert formatted Markdown citations into the current document. If you are using the reference manager [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) the add-in can access your reference database directly.

<!-- Pandoc will automatically generate a list of works cited and place it in the document if the style calls for it. It will be placed in a div with the id refs if one exists: -->

## Acknowledgments {.appendix .unnumbered .unlisted}

I am grateful for the insightful comments offered by the anonymous peer reviewers at Books & Texts. The generosity and expertise of one and all have improved this study in innumerable ways and saved me from many errors; those that inevitably remain are entirely my own responsibility.

<!-- Footnotes -->

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it isn't indented.
